# resolve-lang &mdash; Engineering Directives

> Engineering standards and the definition of done for this project. Read alongside `REPS.md` (root, authoritative) and `dev/ROADMAP.md` (current phase). If anything here conflicts with `REPS.md`, `REPS.md` wins.
> Family plan: `../_lexersketch/` (README rules of engagement, ARCHITECTURE, ISSUES, ROADMAP).

## 0. Philosophy

This library is built and maintained to a production standard and treated as a flagship piece of work. Plan the full path, then build one verified step at a time. "Good enough" is treated as a defect. It is part of the semantic analysis tier (SEMA) of the `-lang` family that LexerSketch assembles.

---

## 1. What this is

resolve-lang owns the walk over HIR binders and references and the resulting resolution index. Scope data structures come from symbol-lang and module graphs from module-lang; resolve-lang is the policy and traversal on top of them.

One resolver serves every forged language because every language reaches it as HIR. Language differences (hoisting, shadowing, namespace merging) are policy settings, not separate code.

## 2. Engineering law (non-negotiable)

- **Ours, not rented.** No third-party runtime dependency. First-party `-lang` crates only, wired when first used. Dev-only test tooling is allowed.
- **Performance.** Peak is the baseline: allocation-free hot paths where feasible, dense ids instead of maps, no "faster" claim without `criterion` numbers at realistic scale (100k+ items).
- **Correctness.** Every invariant in section 4 is covered by property tests, cross-checked against a simple reference implementation wherever one can be written.
- **Hostile-input hardening.** Any input this crate accepts may be adversarial: explicit budgets (depth, size, steps), iterative algorithms, no quadratic paths, no reachable panics.
- **Architecture.** SOLID, KISS, YAGNI; one responsibility; a Tier-1 one-call entry point headlines the docs.
- **Cross-platform.** Linux, macOS, and Windows are first-class, verified by CI on stable and MSRV 1.85.
- **Error handling.** Every fallible path returns `Result`/`Option` per a documented contract; errors are `#[non_exhaustive]` and actionable.
- **Production-ready.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and `#![deny(missing_docs)]` from the first commit; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!`/printing in library code; every public item has rustdoc with a runnable example; every claim in the docs maps to a test.

## 3. Definition of done

1. Compiles clean on Linux/macOS/Windows, stable and MSRV 1.85.
2. `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` (all targets, all/no-default features), `test --all-features`, `cargo doc -D warnings` clean.
3. `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` pass.
4. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in shipping code.
5. A Tier-1 API exists and headlines the docs.
6. Property tests cover every section-4 invariant; a fuzz target exists for every decoder or parser.
7. Hot-path changes carry benchmarks; no regression over 5%.
8. `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated; the matching `docs/release/vX.Y.Z.md` written before the tag.
9. v1.0.0 only after a real consumer has exercised the API end to end (LexerSketch decision D18).

## 4. Project-specific invariants

- Every reference resolves to exactly one binder, or produces exactly one diagnostic.
- Resolution is deterministic and independent of traversal order where the language's policy says it should be (hoisting).
- The index is consistent: every definition's reference list and every reference's target agree.
- Resolution is iterative and budgeted; deeply nested or very large programs never overflow the stack.
